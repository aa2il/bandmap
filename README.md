# Bandmap

A simple gui written in Python to sort & display dx cluster spots. 
Indications as to the age of a spot and the "need" status of a spot's DXCC are also given.  
The rig can be tuned to a spot by clicking on the spot.

This is the first non-trivial python code I wrote and it shows.  It is very much in need of
an over haul at some point.
